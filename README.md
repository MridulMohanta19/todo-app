- View all active tasks.
- Mark tasks as completed.
- View all completed tasks.
- Edit existing tasks.

## Technologies Used

- React
- JavaScript
- HTML

- [React Icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/) (for icons)

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You will need to have the following software installed on your machine:

- Node.js (v12 or higher)
- npm (v6 or higher)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash

   ```

3. **Start the development server**:

   - Update the title and/or description in the input fields that appear.
   - Click the "Save" button to save the changes.

5. **Delete a task**:
   - Click the delete icon next to the task you want to delete.

## Code Structure

- `src/App.js`: The main component containing the logic and rendering for the To-Do list.
- `src/App.css`: The CSS file for styling the components.

## Backend Integration

This frontend application is designed to work with a Node.js backend that provides a RESTful API for managing tasks. Ensure that the backend server is running and accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.
